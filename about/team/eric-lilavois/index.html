        <p><strong>Eric Lilavois</strong> is a senior hospitality executive turned strategic advisor known for scaling mission-driven organizations with clarity, care, and operational rigor. He has served as COO, CEO, and founder across acclaimed hospitality brands, leading teams of more than 1,200 and stewarding revenues of $150 million while building intentional, people-first cultures. He previously served as COO of the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group and founded Elevate Hospitality Management, experience he brings to Campus Ready with a service mindset and a builder’s eye.</p>

        <p>Eric’s commitment to Campus Ready is personal: he knows what it means to arrive on campus with very little—and how much practical, non-tuition support can shape a student’s confidence at the start. He pairs that lived perspective with decades of leadership in systems design, capital raising, and board service, including the St. Helena &amp; Calistoga Boys &amp; Girls Club (2009–2014).</p>

        <p>A graduate of NYU’s Stern School of Business (B.S., Accounting), Eric believes leadership begins with kindness, compassion, and joy—and that hospitality, at its best, is simply care in action. Outside of work, he loves music, art, reading, fitness, good food and wine, and time with the people he loves.</p>

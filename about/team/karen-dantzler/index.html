        <p><strong>Karen Dantzler</strong> is the owner of <strong>KD Customized Fitness</strong>, known for pairing thoughtful, disciplined coaching with genuine care. As co-founder of Campus Ready Foundation, she brings the same tenacity she shows clients to its mission.</p>

        <p>The work is personal for Karen. While moving her son into college last year, she was struck by the hidden costs that stack up before classes even begin. She asked the question that now <em>drives her service</em>—and the foundation itself: how can a family relying on scholarships cover the uncovered costs of getting to school and settling in—travel, move-in essentials, and the basics—so their student starts with confidence? That moment echoed her own start years earlier—moving across the country into her dorm on her own with only a suitcase and a few boxes—an independent, lean beginning that left a lasting imprint.</p>

        <p>What excites Karen most is setting up a superstar student for success, especially those who reached college against the odds. Energized by teammates who lead with intellect, enthusiasm, and heart, she brings a can-do mentality that doesn’t quit.</p>

        <p>Away from work, Karen loves travel, exercise, the theater, dining out, cheering on the Warriors, and time with her husband and son. Her philosophy is simple: there are at least two sides to every situation—and the bright side will always prevail.</p>
